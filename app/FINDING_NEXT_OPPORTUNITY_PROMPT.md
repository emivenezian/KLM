# Prompt: Finding High-Value Optimization Opportunities ($10M+ Annual Impact)

## Context
I'm looking for my next high-value optimization project similar to the KLM cargo loading optimization I built (which generates $10-20M/year in fuel savings). I need help identifying opportunities with:
- Access to real data/confidential processes
- Identifiable inefficiencies (manual processes, heuristic-based decisions)
- Clear optimization potential ($10M+ annual impact)
- Measurable ROI

## My Profile
- Strong technical skills: Optimization algorithms (MILP, Gurobi), full-stack development
- Successful project: Aviation cargo optimization (KLM, $10-20M savings)
- Constraints: Need access to real data/processes (like KLM's confidential cargo data)
- Goal: Find processes with manual/heuristic optimization that can be automated

## Pattern I'm Looking For
**Successful KLM Example:**
- Manual cargo loading process
- Inefficient weight distribution → wasted fuel
- High value: $10-20M/year impact
- Data access: Confidential KLM data enabled validation
- Solution: MILP optimization model

**Key Characteristics:**
- Manual decision-making (spreadsheets, "gut feel")
- High operational costs that scale with volume
- Rules-of-thumb or heuristic-based processes
- No real-time optimization tools
- Experienced operators making intuitive decisions

## Industries to Target
- Logistics/supply chain (warehousing, routing, inventory)
- Manufacturing (production scheduling, resource allocation)
- Energy (grid optimization, demand response)
- Healthcare (operating room scheduling, resource allocation)
- Retail (pricing, inventory, markdowns)
- Transportation (last-mile delivery, fleet routing)

## Data Access Strategies
1. **Academic partnerships**: Professors with industry connections (like my KLM project)
2. **Internships/consulting**: Get access through operations teams
3. **Open data + public inefficiencies**: Government contracts, public records
4. **Competitions/challenges**: Kaggle, hackathons, case competitions
5. **Public sector**: City waste collection, public transport (public data available)

## High-Value Targets ($10M+ Potential)
1. **Last-mile delivery optimization**: Route optimization, driver allocation ($5-50M/year)
2. **Warehouse slotting optimization**: Product placement in warehouses ($2-20M/year)
3. **Hospital operating room scheduling**: OR scheduling, resource allocation ($5-15M/year)
4. **Retail markdown/pricing optimization**: When/how much to discount ($10-100M/year)
5. **Energy grid optimization**: Load balancing, demand response ($20-100M/year)
6. **Manufacturing production scheduling**: Line balancing, job scheduling ($5-30M/year)

## Validation Framework (Before Committing)
- [ ] Can I get access to real data? (Even 1-3 months)
- [ ] Is the problem quantifiable? (Can measure current vs. optimized)
- [ ] Is the impact large enough? ($10M+ annual potential)
- [ ] Can I build a proof-of-concept quickly? (3-6 months)
- [ ] Are there existing solutions? (Competitive analysis)

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Companies already using optimization software (SAP, Oracle)
- Fully automated processes (already optimized)
- Low-volume operations (not enough scale)
- Proprietary algorithms they won't share
- No clear ROI metric

## Research Methodology
1. **Identify inefficiency signals**: "We've always done it this way", manual processes, spreadsheets
2. **Quantify opportunity**: Cost per decision × frequency × inefficiency %
3. **Validate with data**: Start small (1-3 months), prove 10-20% improvement, scale

## Questions to Ask About Each Opportunity
1. Where is the waste? (Fuel, time, inventory, labor)
2. How is it currently optimized? (Manual, rules, simple heuristics)
3. What data exists? (Historical decisions, outcomes)
4. What's the scale? (Volume × frequency × unit cost)
5. Who makes decisions? (Operations managers, analysts, executives)

## Best Next Targets (Recommended)
1. **Last-mile delivery optimization**: Massive scale, clear inefficiency, measurable impact
2. **Manufacturing production scheduling**: High value, accessible via industrial engineering partnerships

## Action Plan
- Month 1-2: Research (industry reports, conferences, professors)
- Month 3-4: Outreach (companies, consultants, internships)
- Month 5-6: Pilot (get data, build proof-of-concept, demonstrate value)

## What I Need Help With
1. Identify specific companies/processes with optimization potential
2. Strategies for getting data access (academic partnerships, internships, public data)
3. Validation of opportunity size and feasibility
4. Competitive analysis (existing solutions in the space)
5. Best approach for initial outreach and partnership development

## Output Format
For each opportunity suggested, provide:
- Company/industry name
- Specific problem/inefficiency
- Data access strategy
- Estimated annual value ($X-$YM)
- Approach/pathway to get started
- Key contacts/networking opportunities

Please help me find my next $10M+ optimization opportunity with accessible data and clear value proposition.

## Specific recommendation

**Best next target: Last-mile delivery optimization**

Why:
- Massive scale (millions of deliveries/day globally)
- Clear inefficiency (drivers waste time on routes)
- Measurable impact (fuel, time, customer satisfaction)
- Data access: Public delivery data, partnerships with delivery companies
- Market size: $100B+ industry

**Approach:**
1. Partner with local delivery companies (start small)
2. Use public delivery data (if available)
3. Build routing optimization tool
4. Show 15-20% improvement
5. Scale to larger companies

Or: **Manufacturing production scheduling**

Why:
- High value ($5-30M/year per facility)
- Clear problem (machine utilization, overtime costs)
- Data accessible via industrial engineering partnerships
- Less competitive than logistics

## Bottom line

The pattern:
1. Find manual/heuristic-based processes
2. Get access to real data (via partnerships, internships, public data)
3. Build optimization tool
4. Prove value (10-20% improvement)
5. Scale and commercialize

Best path: Partner with operations research professors who consult for companies. They have access, you have the building skills.
